    <h1>Timezone Bot - Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
        <b>When you grab a timezone role</b> (<code>/timezone [tz_name]</code> command), the bot saves the following information about you:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The ID of the server you grabbed a timezone role on</li>
        <li>Your user ID</li>
        <li>Your timezone</li>
        <li>Your nickname and username - This is necessary for the <code>/list-timezones</code> command</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This information is kept as long as you still have your timezone role, to keep it up-to-date. It is deleted:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>immediately</b> if you get rid of your timezone role with <code>/remove-timezone</code></li>
        <li><b>within 15 minutes</b> if Timezone Bot is kicked from the server you had a timezone role in</li>
        <li><b>within a few days</b> if you leave the server you had a timezone role in</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="space">
        <b>Some information is also logged</b> in order to help with troubleshooting and checking the bot works as intended:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>server joins/leaves</li>
        <li>list of roles that have access to <code>/toggle-times</code> when the permissions of this command is updated on the server</li>
        <li>Timezone Bot commands that are run</li>
        <li>role changes done by the bot</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Those logs are deleted after <b>7 days</b>.
    </p>

    <p class="space">
        The collected information is only used for troubleshooting issues and to make the commands work.
        They are <b>only accessible to the bot owner</b>, and <b>they are not used for anything else.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you do not use the bot's slash commands, <b>no information is logged or saved about you</b>
        (and due to how <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateway-intents" target="_blank">Discord gateway intents</a> work,
        said information is not even sent to the bot: it only asks for <code>GUILDS</code> events).
