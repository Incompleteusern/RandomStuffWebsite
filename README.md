# max480-random-stuff website

This is (part of) the source code for the max480-random-stuff.appspot.com website, a [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) app.

It contains the full source for:
- [the Everest Update Checker frontend service](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/everest_update.yaml)
- [the Celeste custom entity catalog](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/custom-entity-catalog)
- [the everest.yaml validator](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/everest-yaml-validator)
- Some [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com)-related APIs for the Celeste community described in the few next sections.

If you want to check how the update checker's everest_update.yaml file is generated, check [the Everest Update Checker Server repo](https://github.com/max4805/EverestUpdateCheckerServer) instead.

## The GameBanana search API

This API uses the mod search database generated by [the Everest Update Checker server](https://github.com/max4805/EverestUpdateCheckerServer) to find mods based on keywords. **This searches Celeste mods only**.

It is used by [Olympus](https://github.com/EverestAPI/Olympus), the Everest installer and mod manager, to search Celeste mods on GameBanana.

To use this API, call `https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/gamebanana-search?q=[search]`. The answer is in yaml format, and is a list of the top 20 matches. For example:

```
$ curl https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/gamebanana-search?q=spring+collab+2020
- {itemtype: Map, itemid: 211745}
- {itemtype: Gamefile, itemid: 13452}
- {itemtype: Map, itemid: 212317}
- {itemtype: Gamefile, itemid: 13185}
- {itemtype: Gui, itemid: 35325}
- {itemtype: Gamefile, itemid: 13258}
- {itemtype: Map, itemid: 212999}
- {itemtype: Gamefile, itemid: 12784}
- {itemtype: Gamefile, itemid: 9486}
```

Here the top 2 results are https://gamebanana.com/maps/211745 (The 2020 Celeste Spring Community Collab) and https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/13452 (2020 Spring Collab Randomizer).

The search engine is powered by [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/). It supports, among other things:
- searching for a **phrase**: `"Spring Collab"`
- **OR** and **NOT** keywords: `Spring Collab NOT Randomizer`
- searching for other fields in GameBanana submissions:
  - the **name** (default): `name: (Spring Collab 2020)`
  - the GameBanana **type**: `type: gamefile`, `type: map`, etc.
  - the GameBanana **ID**: `id: 9486` (those can be found at the end of links to mods)
  - one of the **authors**: `author: max480`
  - the **summary** (line that appears first on the page): `summary: (grab bag)`
  - the **description**: `description: "flag touch switches"`

For a full list of supported syntax, check [the Lucene documentation](https://lucene.apache.org/core/8_7_0/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#package.description).

## The GameBanana sorted list API

This API allows to get a sorted list of most downloaded, liked or viewed Celeste mods on GameBanana.

Since the information used by this API can be late by up to 30 minutes, it does not allow to retrieve the _latest_ mods. For that, use [the real GameBanana API](https://api.gamebanana.com/docs/endpoints/Core/List/New) instead.

The URL is `https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/gamebanana-list?sort=[sort]&type=[type]&page=[page]` where:
- `sort` is the info to sort on (**mandatory**). It can be `likes`, `views` or `downloads`
- `type` is the GameBanana type to filter on (optional and case-insensitive). For example `Map`, `Gamefile` or `Tool`
- `page` is the page to get, first page being 1 (optional, default is 1). Each page contains 20 elements.

The output format is the same as the GameBanana search API, [see the previous section](#the-gamebanana-search-api).

## GameBanana categories list API

This API allows getting a list of GameBanana item types _that have at least one Celeste mod in it_ (contrary to [the official GameBanana API for this](https://api.gamebanana.com/Core/Item/Data/AllowedItemTypes?&help)), along with how many mods there are for each category.

The counts returned by this API might not match the numbers displayed on the GameBanana website; that's because GameBanana counts mods that do not show up in the list.

The URL is `https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/gamebanana-categories` and the result looks like:
```yaml
- itemtype: ''
  formatted: All
  count: 541
- itemtype: Effect
  formatted: Effects
  count: 2
- itemtype: Gamefile
  formatted: Game files
  count: 114
- itemtype: Gui
  formatted: GUIs
  count: 11
...
```

## GameBanana WebP to PNG API

This API simply downloads a WebP image from GameBanana, and converts it to PNG. **This can only be used with GameBanana screenshots.**

Usage example: https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/webp-to-png?src=https://screenshots.gamebanana.com/img/ss/gamefiles/5b05ac2b4b6da.webp

This API may answer with a 302 (redirect) leading to the actual image on Google Cloud Storage. Images are cached there for 30 days, to avoid having to convert it each time.
