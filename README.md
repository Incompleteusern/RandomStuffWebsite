# max480-random-stuff website

This is the source code for the [max480-random-stuff.appspot.com](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/) website, a [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) app running on Java 8.

The `src` folder contains the source for everything provided by the Java servlet:
- [the Everest Update Checker frontend service](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/everest_update.yaml), exposing files produced by the Update Checker
- [the Celeste custom entity catalog](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/custom-entity-catalog), and [its API version](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/custom-entity-catalog.json)
- [the everest.yaml validator](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/everest-yaml-validator)
- [the Everest Update Checker status page](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/update-checker-status)
- [the Celeste font generator](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/font-generator)
- [the Celeste Mod Structure Verifier](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/mod-structure-verifier)
- [the #celeste_news_network subscription service](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/news-network-subscription) - the Twitter update checking code is not part of the frontend and can be found [on the Random Backend Stuff repository](https://github.com/max4805/RandomBackendStuff/blob/main/src/celeste-backend-crontabs/TwitterUpdateChecker.java)
- [the help page for the Mod Structure Verifier bot](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/mod-structure-verifier-help?collabName=CollabName&collabMapName=CollabMapName&assets&xmls&nomap&multiplemaps&badmappath&badenglish&misplacedyaml&noyaml&yamlinvalid&missingassets&missingentities&missingfonts)
- [the "Show Arbitrary Mods on Profile" GameBanana app](https://gamebanana.com/apps/752)
- [the Discord Games Bot](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/discord-bots#games-bot) - the "bot" is actually a webhook that gets called by Discord
- [the Discord Custom Slash Commands app](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/discord-bots#custom-slash-commands)
- Some [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com)-related APIs extending the official API, described below
- [the Olympus News API](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/olympus-news)
- [the Everest versions list API](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/everest-versions)
- ... and some other things of more limited use that are on the website.

The `front-vue` folder contains the source for more dynamic frontend parts made in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/):
- [the Banana Mirror Browser](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/banana-mirror-browser), a website that can substitute to [the GameBanana Celeste section](https://gamebanana.com/games/6460) if it is down. Files and images are [hosted on 0x0ade's server](https://celestemodupdater.0x0a.de/). Mod info and files on this server are kept up-to-date by [the Everest update checker](https://github.com/max4805/EverestUpdateCheckerServer).
- [the Celeste Map Tree Viewer](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/map-tree-viewer), a tool allowing you to see the raw contents of your map .bin as a tree, in order to find out what it is or search for a specific entity, trigger, decal or styleground.
- [the Celeste Wipe Converter](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/wipe-converter), a service to turn custom Celeste screen wipes into a format the game can use (with the [max480's Helping Hand](https://github.com/max4805/MaxHelpingHand) mod).

If you want to check how the update checker's everest_update.yaml file is generated, check [the Everest Update Checker Server repo](https://github.com/max4805/EverestUpdateCheckerServer) instead.

## GameBanana search API

This API uses the mod search database generated by [the Everest Update Checker server](https://github.com/max4805/EverestUpdateCheckerServer) to find mods based on keywords. **This searches Celeste mods only**.

It is used by [Olympus](https://github.com/EverestAPI/Olympus), the Everest installer and mod manager, to search Celeste mods on GameBanana.

To use this API, call `https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/gamebanana-search?q=[search]`. The answer is in yaml format, and is a list of the top 20 matches. For example:

```
$ curl https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/gamebanana-search?q=spring+collab+2020
- {itemtype: Map, itemid: 211745}
- {itemtype: Gamefile, itemid: 13452}
- {itemtype: Map, itemid: 212317}
- {itemtype: Gamefile, itemid: 13185}
- {itemtype: Gui, itemid: 35325}
- {itemtype: Gamefile, itemid: 13258}
- {itemtype: Map, itemid: 212999}
- {itemtype: Gamefile, itemid: 12784}
- {itemtype: Gamefile, itemid: 9486}
```

Here the top 2 results are https://gamebanana.com/maps/211745 (The 2020 Celeste Spring Community Collab) and https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/13452 (2020 Spring Collab Randomizer).

The search engine is powered by [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/). It supports, among other things:
- searching for a **phrase**: `"Spring Collab"`
- **OR** and **NOT** keywords: `Spring Collab NOT Randomizer`
- searching for other fields in GameBanana submissions:
  - the **name** (default): `name: (Spring Collab 2020)`
  - the GameBanana **type**: `type: gamefile`, `type: map`, etc.
  - the GameBanana **ID**: `id: 9486` (those can be found at the end of links to mods)
  - the GameBanana **category**: `category: Textures`
  - one of the **authors**: `author: max480`
  - the **summary** (line that appears first on the page): `summary: (grab bag)`
  - the **description**: `description: "flag touch switches"`

For a full list of supported syntax, check [the Lucene documentation](https://lucene.apache.org/core/8_7_0/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/classic/package-summary.html#package.description).

You can pass `full=true` to the API to get the full info on mods instead of just their IDs, **in JSON instead of YAML**:

```yaml
$ curl "https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/gamebanana-search?q=spring+collab+2020&full=true"

## GameBanana sorted list API

This API allows to get a sorted list of most downloaded, liked or viewed Celeste mods on GameBanana.

If you want to retrieve the latest mod with no type filter, it is recommended to use [the real GameBanana API](https://api.gamebanana.com/docs/endpoints/Core/List/New) instead, for more up-to-date information.

The URL is `https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/gamebanana-list?sort=[sort]&type=[type]&category=[category]&page=[page]` where:
- `sort` is the info to sort on (**mandatory**). It can be `latest`, `likes`, `views` or `downloads`
- `type` (or `itemtype`) is the GameBanana type to filter on (optional and case-insensitive). For example `Map`, `Gamefile` or `Tool`
- `category` is the GameBanana mod category ID to filter on (optional), this is returned by [the GameBanana categories list API](#gamebanana-categories-list-api). For example `944`
- `page` is the page to get, first page being 1 (optional, default is 1). Each page contains 20 elements.

The output format is the same as the GameBanana search API, [see the previous section](#the-gamebanana-search-api). You also get the total amount of mods in the list, as a `X-Total-Count` header.

You can pass `full=true` to the API to get the full info on mods instead of just their IDs, **in JSON**. The format is also the same as the GameBanana search API with `full=true`.

## GameBanana featured mods list API

Hit the following URL: `https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/gamebanana-featured` to get a list of all mods that are shown in the front page of Celeste.

The output is JSON, in the same as the GameBanana search API with the `full=true` option ([see the previous section](#the-gamebanana-search-api)).

Each mod has a `Featured` key if it is featured. The `Category` is one of the following:
- `today`: Best of today
- `week`: Best of this week
- `month`: Best of this month
- `3month`: Best of 3 months
- `6month`: Best of 6 months
- `year`: Best of this year
- `alltime`: Best of all time

This API sorts the mods in the same order as they are on the website: by `Category` (following the order above) then by `Position`.

## GameBanana categories list API

This API allows getting a list of GameBanana item types _that have at least one Celeste mod in it_ (contrary to [the official GameBanana v2 API for this](https://api.gamebanana.com/Core/Item/Data/AllowedItemTypes?&help)), along with how many mods there are for each category.

The counts returned by this API might not match the numbers displayed on the GameBanana website; that's because GameBanana counts mods that do not show up in the list.

Each entry can have an `itemtype` and a `categoryid`, that can be used as `type` and `category` parameters on the [list API](#gamebanana-sorted-list-api).

The URL is `https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/gamebanana-categories?version=3` and the result looks like:
```yaml
- formatted: All
  count: 1406
- itemtype: Mod
  categoryid: 15655
  formatted: Assets
  count: 26
- itemtype: Mod
  categoryid: 4633
  formatted: Dialog
  count: 20
- itemtype: Mod
  categoryid: 1501
  formatted: Effects
  count: 5
- itemtype: Tool
  formatted: Tools
  count: 30
...
```

Older versions are available for backwards compatibility:
- `?version=2` does not include `itemtype: Mod` for mods, and the "All" category has `itemtype: ''`
- `?version=1` (or omitting entirely) only groups by itemtype (so all Mods end up in one big category)

## GameBanana category RSS feed API

_Note that this API works for all GameBanana categories, not only Celeste ones._

This API uses the "get mods for a category" API from GameBanana, then turns the result in an RSS format.

Usage is very similar to the "vanilla" GameBanana API, since it calls it directly behind the scenes: for example, getting the latest Celeste helpers (https://gamebanana.com/mods/cats/5081 :arrow_right: ID is 5081) is done with
```
https://gamebanana.com/apiv8/Mod/ByCategory?_csvProperties=@gbprofile&_aCategoryRowIds[]=5081&_sOrderBy=_tsDateAdded,DESC&_nPerpage=10
```

You can get them in the RSS format by just replacing the URL and carrying over all query params except `_csvProperties`:
```
https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/gamebanana/rss-feed?_aCategoryRowIds[]=5081&_sOrderBy=_tsDateAdded,DESC&_nPerpage=10
```

You can copy this URL replacing `5081` with the category of your choice to get a feed for the latest mods in this category.
To include mod updates (and not only new mods), replace `_tsDateAdded` with `_tsDateUpdated`.

If the GameBanana API returns an error (for example if you pass an invalid parameter), this API will return it as is.

## Random Celeste map button

Click [here](https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/random-map) to get redirected to a random Celeste map.

## Olympus News API

This API is available at `https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/olympus-news`, and returns the news to display in Olympus, in JSON format. For example:
```json
[
  {
    "preview": "Shattering Strawberries is a mod that lets you make your favourite collectable explode, and was created entirely by catapillie! Featuring customisable settings for amount of jooce and shards, you can check it out here:",
    "image": "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FRfYg5zUcAAIa1a.jpg",
    "link": "https://gamebanana.com/mods/374294",
    "title": "Shattering Strawberries"
  }
]
```

The fields are all optional, and are:
- `title`: the title of the news
- `preview`: the text directly displayed in the sidebar of Olympus
- `image`: an image that will be displayed between the `title` and the `preview`
- `link`: a link that can be opened by clicking an "Open in browser" button (links in the `preview` are not clickable)
- `text`: longer text that can be viewed in a popup by clicking a button at the bottom of the news

The contents of the API are based on the 10 most recent tweets of [the @EverestAPI Twitter](https://twitter.com/EverestAPI):
- `preview` is filled with the tweet text, excluding non-ascii characters
- `image` is filled with the first image of the tweet. If there is none, the embed image of the first link that has one in the message will be taken instead.
- `title` is filled with the embed title of the first link that has one in the message. To accomodate GameBanana links better, `[Celeste] [Mods]` is also removed from it.
- `link` is filled with the first link in the tweet. This link is also removed from the `preview`.

[A file from the RandomBackendStuff repository](https://github.com/max4805/RandomBackendStuff/blob/main/olympusnews.json) allows to edit this feed, in order to keep control over it. The format is the following:
```json
{
    "add_before": [
        { "entry1" },
        { "entry2" }
    ],
    "add_after": [
        { "entry3" },
        { "entry4" }
    ],
    "replace": {
        "tweetID1": { "entry5" }
    },
    "delete": ["tweetID2", "tweetID3"]
}
```
All `entry` JSON objects follow the format of news entries (`title`, `preview`, etc).
- The entries in `add_before` will be added before the 10 tweets in the news feed
- The entries in `add_after` will be added after the 10 tweets in the news feed
- The entries in `replace` overwrite the tweets with the given Twitter IDs in the feed
- The tweets with the IDs listed in `delete` will be deleted from the feed, and older tweets will be taken instead to reach 10 tweets

## Everest versions list API

This API is available at `https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/everest-versions`, and returns all the Everest versions available, in JSON format.  For example:
```json
[
    {
        "version": 3520,
        "branch": "dev",
        "author": "bigkahuna443",
        "description": "Handle duplicate room names",
        "date": "2022-08-10T15:09:33.8105837Z",
        "mainDownload": "https://dev.azure.com/EverestAPI/Everest/_apis/build/builds/2820/artifacts?artifactName=main&api-version=5.0&%24format=zip",
        "olympusMetaDownload": "https://dev.azure.com/EverestAPI/Everest/_apis/build/builds/2820/artifacts?artifactName=olympus-meta&api-version=5.0&%24format=zip",
        "olympusBuildDownload": "https://dev.azure.com/EverestAPI/Everest/_apis/build/builds/2820/artifacts?artifactName=olympus-build&api-version=5.0&%24format=zip"
    },
    [...]
]
```

- `version` is the Everest version number.
- `branch` is eiter `dev`, `beta` or `stable`. Other branches might be created to test specific features in the future.
- `mainDownload` is the download for use by Everest to install an update.
- `date` is the date at which the version was published, in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.
- `olympusMetaDownload` is the download that Olympus uses to get the build size.
- `olympusBuildDownload` is the download for use by Olympus to install Everest.

Two extra fields are specified for automatic builds made after a single change (commit or pull request merge):
- `author` is the author of the change (GitHub username), either the author of the commit or the creator of the pull request.
- `description` is the description of the change, either the message of the commit or the title of the pull request.

## GameBanana Image Mirror API (deprecated)

**Deprecated: You can get the direct URL to the mirrored images by checking `MirroredScreenshots`** in the response of the [search](#gamebanana-search-api) and [list](#gamebanana-sorted-list-api) APIs (by passing `full=true`), and in the [featured mod list](#gamebanana-featured-mods-list-api) API.

--------

This API redirects to a mirror of a GameBanana image on [Banana Mirror](https://celestemodupdater.0x0a.de/banana-mirror-images), hosted by 0x0ade.

This contains every 1st and 2nd screenshot of Celeste submissions on GameBanana, downscaled to 220x220, and converted to PNG.

Usage example: `https://max480-random-stuff.appspot.com/celeste/banana-mirror-image?src=https://images.gamebanana.com/img/ss/mods/5b05ac2b4b6da.webp`

_For compatibility reasons, you can also use `webp-to-png` instead of `banana-mirror-image`._
